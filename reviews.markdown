## Overall Semester 1 Rating: 7.5/10
{: #overall-rating }

### Breakdown
- **Academics (quality)**: 9/10 - it's CMU, the professors are pretty good and the content taught is hard, but not unlearnable if you put the effort and time in. There are lots of resources to help you including office hours, lecture notes, recitations, friends, taking notes, online forums, etc
- **Academics (enjoyment)**: 6.5/10 - so much work omg and it's very stressful at a lot of times because the classes are really difficult and have a lot of problem sets (for all four of the technical classes) and sometimes weeks are just studying for midterms, requires so much focus and concentration in class. I did enjoy what we learned in class though, and the content being challenging is a good thing. I just had to get used ot it first. 
- **Social**: 8/10 - Before college my greatest worry was making friends I could laugh and live with and feel comfortable around, I think in college I was able to just be myself and care less about what other people think and eventually I've interacted with a lot of people and know who I enjoy being around. 
- **Health**: 7/10 - mentally there was quite a bit of stress about having to do work, but that got better throughout the semester as I got used to it so that all that was left was to just do it. Physically, I think I ate enough every day and slept a fair amount, although a lot of times I was falling asleep in class and would wake up every 5 minutes to jot down notes and just go back to dozing off. Probably did not get enough exercise, but being in college I did walk a ton (averaging 11,000 steps a day) and tried to go biking/running/somewhere for fun sometimes\\

In-class: 2 hours/week\\
Homework: <1 hour/week\\
**Total work: 2 hours/week**\\
**Difficulty: 1/10**\\
**Rating: 6/10**\\
This class was okay, I can see why it's useful but at 4:00 pm I'm pretty gassed and to me this was often just an hour of sitting and zoning out or napping. 


### 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation
{: #course-15-122 }
Nickname: 122\\
Professor: Anne Kohlbrenner\\
Credits: 12\\

**Total work: 14 hours/week**\\
**Difficulty: 8/10**\\
**Rating: 8/10**\\
Honestly a great class, at first I hated the checkins because they were soooo stressful but I think I'm pretty good at approaching stressful tests with a good mentality of "okay, let's see what I can do. Just have fun and enjoy the challenge...". I scored below average at first, (40-50) but as the semester went on I started scoring above the median (50-60). I loved the programming assignments! They were so much work but also so satisfying when the code worked. The end results of what I got to create were really cool. Anne was a great professor, I loved her enthusiasm! This class I found a pretty good routine for as well in order to prepare myself for the checkin every Tuesday. I came in with only AP CSA knowledge (and some python programming experience in data science) so I didn't know any of the data structures at first or how C worked. 


### 15-151 Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science
{: #course-15-151 }
Nickname: Concepts\\
Professors: John Mackey and William Kuszmaul\\
Credits: 12\\
In-class: 5 hours/week\\
Homework: avg 8 hours/week\\
- Problem set = 6-12 hours/week

Extra work: avg 2 hours/week
- Takes notes on Clive = ~2-3 hours/week

**Total work: 15 hours/week**\\
**Difficulty: 8.5/10**\\
**Rating: 9/10**\\
I loved the lectures for this class because Mackey was a great entertainer and Will had so much aura. Also, in general, in class they often solved some pretty fascinating problems (I didn't always know what was going on but it was cool). I have a math competition background, so I enjoy math in general and thought it was really cool to learn how to prove things rigorously! The first three weeks were pretty difficult, but it was challenging in a pretty rewarding and enjoyable way. Some of the later topics, like counting and probability involved things I learned before through competition math or AP Statistics haha. I found functions and countability/infinite sets pretty hard. 


### 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations
{: #course-21-241 }
Nickname: 241, linear\\
Professor: Pavel Kovalev\\
Credits: 11\\
In-class: 5 hours/week\\
Homework: avg 6 hours/week
- Problem set = 4-5 hours/week
- Office Hours = 1-2 hours/week

**Total work: 11 hours/week**\\
Final Project: ~12 hours w Steven Gu on Spectral Clustering\\
**Difficulty: 8/10**\\
**Rating: 6/10**\\
Did not really like this class, I can see how it's super useful in CS but I struggled remembering all the relationships between subspaces and matrices and pivot columns and everything because the proofs seemed sorta arbitrary and dependent on axioms that didn't completely make sense to me. Also, it was hard to visualize a lot of it. There were a lot of formulas and definitions to memorize, and in class Pavel went pretty fast so I was just trying to scribble notes the whole time. Although I understand there is a lot of content to cover, and he was pretty good-natured and a good lecturer. What I heard from upperclassman (although they had a different lecturer) was that this class was pretty easy, but I think I found it almost as hard as concepts, maybe even more so at times. I found concepts more intuitive at times. I stressed a lot about the final project, but it ended up being really cool to research and implement. 


### 33-151 Matter and Interactions
{: #course-33-151 }
Nickname: Physics, M&I\\
Professor: Diana Parno\\
Credits: 12\\
In-class: 5 hours/week\\
Homework: avg 5 hours/week
- Problem set = 3-4 hours/week
- Programming Assignment = 1-2 hours/week

**Total work: 10 hours/week**\\
Final Project: ~7 hours w Samarth Agarwal and Caleb Tai on Elastic Pendulums\\
**Difficulty: 7/10**\\
**Rating: 7.5/10**\\
This was my general education class, I had to email the professor to get in since I'm not in MCS and this is the honors physics class intended for physics majors. Before college I thought I wanted to potentially minor in physics, so I wanted to take this class and see what physics is like in college. I think in general the class touched on some pretty interesting subjects, but maybe 70% of it was review of AP Physics C Mechanics. A lot of it was just applying formulas though. Since this was my gen-ed it was sort of the sacrificial class (I basically didn't read the textbook) when I was drowning in my CS classes, but I think I do still enjoy physics and want to take more physics classes in the future. Maybe not minor though, I don't wanna take experimental physics...


### 57-121 Piano Elective Studio
{: #course-57-121 }
Nickname: Piano lesson\\
Professor: Hyun Jin Curtin\\
Credits: 3\\
In-class: 1 hour/week\\
Practice: avg 2 hours/week\\
**Total work: 3 hours/week**\\
Final Student Recital: Wow so many talented and hardworking people (not me lol)\\
**Difficulty: 6/10**\\
**Rating: 8.5/10**\\
I wanted to try out private piano lessons since I wanted to keep piano/music in my life, and honestly I learned a lot from this professor because she taught very differently from my previous piano teacher. She pointed out a lot of my hand positions/form and gave me new perspective on noticing details in the music which was really cool (before I would mostly sightread and then focus on details later). I unfortunately didn't practice enough to spend that much money on lessons but if I find time to practice I think it's worth it. So it was a bit frustrating because I didn't make a ton of progress practically, but did learn a lot theoretically. I loved getting id card access to the practice rooms!

Mehhhh online course I just tried to get through as fast as possible. Probably could have gotten more out of it but at the time I was focused on other things.

### Reflection
If I were to do anything differently... probably worry less, haha. I felt guilty a lot of times when I wasn't studying. I did take most of the opportunities presented to me though, and I would randomly add events to my calendar that I see in posters. I probably went to 50% of the stuff I added though. I initiated a lot of my outings with friends!
